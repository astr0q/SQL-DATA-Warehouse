# 🏗️ Data Warehouse Project – Bronze, Silver, Gold Layers

## 📖 Overview

This project implements a **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)** for building a scalable, reliable, and business-ready **data warehouse**.

* **Bronze Layer** → Raw data ingestion (immutable source of truth).
* **Silver Layer** → Standardized, cleansed, and conformed data.
* **Gold Layer** → Curated business-level data modeled for **analytics & reporting**.

## 🔹 Bronze Layer

**Purpose:**

* Capture **raw data** from source systems (CRM, ERP, APIs, flat files).
* Preserve **full fidelity** with minimal transformations.

**Key Features:**

* Schema-on-read.
* Metadata enrichment (e.g., load date, source system).
* Historical preservation for reprocessing.

**Example Tables:**

* `bronze.crm_sales_raw`
* `bronze.products_raw`
* `bronze.customers_raw`

---

## 🔸 Silver Layer

**Purpose:**

* Provide **cleaned, standardized, and conformed** datasets.
* Serve as the **foundation** for business modeling.

**Key Features:**

* Standardized naming & data types.
* Duplicate handling & data validation.
* Basic enrichment & conformance to master data.

**Example Tables:**

* `silver.crm_sales_details` – cleansed CRM sales records.
* `silver.dim_products_staging` – standardized product attributes.
* `silver.dim_customers_staging` – deduplicated customer records.

---

## 🟡 Gold Layer

**Purpose:**

* Deliver **business-ready data** for reporting and analytics.
* Modeled using **star schema** (facts + dimensions).

**Key Features:**

* Fact tables store business transactions/measures.
* Dimension tables store descriptive attributes.
* Optimized for BI tools (Power BI, Tableau, Looker).

**Example Tables:**

### 🧍 gold.dim\_customers

* Stores enriched customer information (demographics, geography).

### 📦 gold.dim\_products

* Provides product details (categories, product lines, costs).

### 💰 gold.fact\_sales

* Transactional sales fact table linked to dimensions.

---

## ✅ Data Quality Checks

* **Uniqueness** of surrogate keys in dimension tables.
* **Referential integrity** between fact and dimension tables.
* **Completeness & consistency** validations.

---

## 🚀 Usage Workflow

1. **Ingest raw data → Bronze Layer**
2. **Clean & standardize → Silver Layer**
3. **Model facts & dimensions → Gold Layer**
4. **Run quality checks → Validate integrity**
5. **Consume → BI dashboards & analytics**

---

## 🌟 Benefits

* 🔎 **Traceability** – from raw → cleansed → business-ready.
* 📊 **Consistency** – standardized definitions across reports.
* ⚡ **Scalability** – supports growth in data volume and complexity.
* 🔐 **Governance** – audit-ready data lineage.

---

✨ With this layered approach, the project ensures **trustworthy, analytics-ready data** for business decision-making.
